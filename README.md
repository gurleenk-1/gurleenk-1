  Hi, I'm Gurleen! <br/>
  
</h1>
<a> 
My background is in analytics and engineering, where I’ve spent time investigating data quality issues, diagnosing performance gaps, and building dashboards that teams can actually rely on. I enjoy working with imperfect, real-world data using SQL, BI tools, Python and structured analysis to understand what’s happening underneath the surface and why it matters for operational and business outcomes.
